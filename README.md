# 🚀 Freelancing Project – Digital Marketing Website

This is a professional **digital marketing website** built as a freelance project for a client starting their business in:

- 📱 App & Web Development  
- 📈 SEO Optimization  
- 📢 Advertising  
- 💻 Digital Marketing Solutions  

The goal of the project was to create a **clean, responsive, and animated web interface** to represent the client’s services. Through this, I gained valuable experience in frontend UI/UX design and development.
